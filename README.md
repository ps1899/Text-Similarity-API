# Text-Similarity-API
I built an immersive Full-Stack API service website which allows user to compare the similarity of two text pieces.  
There are some major features in this website:  
- NextJS 13 Client & Server Components
- Rate Limited API routes
- Protection of sensitive routes
- Beautiful light / dark mode
- Full authentication
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Super fast Planetscale database
- A complete API key system to create & revoke user keys
